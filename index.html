      <p style="color:white; opacity:0.5;">Susanne Aubert is a Norwegian music composer for films and video games. <br>Heavily influenced by her grandparents love for tango and jazz, she started<br> her musical journey regularly performing in the car alongside her brother <br>while her grandfather would whistle. This went on for a while and <br>throughout her childhood she would pick up different instruments like <br>guitar, french horn and piano without really mastering any of them. <br><br><br>She moved to London and started her BMus in Popular Music Performance<br> at ICMP. Susanne worked as a professional Jazz vocalist before shifting her <br>focus onto composition. At the music college Susanne had the brilliant<br> composer <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3489802/"> Maurizio Malagnini </a> (BBC Call the Midwifes) as a teacher and he <br>really opened up her eyes to the world of composing for film and video <br>games -  from there she was hooked.

        Intensive studies got Susanne into<br> and through <a href="https://valencia.berklee.edu/">Berklee College of Music</a> where she got her M.M. in Scoring for<br> Film, Television and Video Games. <br><br><br>In 2017 Aubert collaborated with animator <a href="http://www.rosabeiroa.com/">Rosa Beiroa</a> on some of her<br> student projects which, to both of their amazement, went on to screen<br> and win awards from prestigious festivals all over the world such asÂ Le <br>Petit Cannes, Kuandu International Animation Festival, Dinard, Elche,<br>La Truca, Montreal Feminist Film Festival and many others. 
        
        <br><br><br>Susanne currently lives in Lisbon where she works as a freelance composer<br> and designer on projects that she is truly passionate about.
